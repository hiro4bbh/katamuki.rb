## What is katamuki.rb?
katamuki.rb is a simple Gradient Boosting library written in Ruby.

Currently, katamuki.rb cannot be used in general settings, because
katamuki.rb only supports data in `JgramDatabase*`, which is required for
running `sample/syscalls`.

## How to use katamuki.rb?
Currently, katamuki.rb is extremely unstable, so there is not gem for
katamuki.rb or installation scripts for deployment.
Furthermore, katamuki.rb is only tested on my macOS Sierra.

See https://github.com/hiro4bbh/hako.rb README.md for installation.
